Assembler Printing Program  #a.asm

The program isolates a single digit each time and checks if it is a letter or a digit. 
Accordingly, a value is added according to the ASCII table, and sent to the DL register in order to display.
This whole program boils down to a simple print operation like in Python or any other language.
